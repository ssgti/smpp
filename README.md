# SMPP/Stock Market Prediction Project
software that aims to create educated guesses of stock performance based on current news events and past financial data, created for my computer science A level NEA

currently unfinished and in development

this program is set up to use a database that is hosted locally on my PC, if you wish to run this in it's current state you will need to create a MySQL database using the db.mwb file and edit the connection strings accordingly

when this program releases it will be supplied without a connection string or API key so you will need to sort those out yourself

***// disclaimer - this software is a proof-of-concept, and should not be used as the basis for actual trading decisions. I accept no responsibility for money lost due to trades made because of this software***
