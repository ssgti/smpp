# SMPP/Stock Market Prediction Project
software that aims to create educated guesses of stock performance based on current news events and past financial data. this repo contains the code and files i create for my computer science A level NEA project.

currently unfinished and in development
it's also set up to use a database that is hosted locally on my PC, if you wish to run this you will need to create a MySQL database using the db.mwb file and edit the connection strings accordingly.
it would be nice if you could get your own Alpha Vantage API key - they are free, after all.

***// disclaimer - this software is a proof-of-concept, and should not be used as the basis for actual trading decisions. I accept no responsibility for money lost due to trades made because of this software.***
